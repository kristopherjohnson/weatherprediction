Weather Prediction
==================

This repository contains code for experiments in using machine learning to predict weather.

These are personal projects by a machine-learning neophyte.  Use at your own risk.

The code requires a _lot_ of data downloaded from NOAA.  That data is not included in this repository.  For more info, see these resources:
